## PhD Dissertation

**Dissertation Title:** Breaking the glass ceiling is not enough: Gendered selection bias and inequitable inclusion

In my dissertation, I examine how gender-based selection bias shapes women's representation, influence, power and behavior within political institutions. My findings highlight a critical distinction between \emph{descriptive representation} and what I introduce as \emph{equal inclusion}. My findings reveal that women are not only underrepresented descriptively; they are also unequally represented in the opportunities, expectations, and constraints that shape their careers. In other words, they are not equally included after having broken the glass ceiling. I demonstrate that gendered selection bias limits women's advancement at every stage: It affects whether they are initially selected, whether they are promoted once inside institutions, how their performance is valued and evaluated, the influence they are able to exert, and the harsher incentives they face in order to secure future opportunities.
